How to create a container image &amp; what is a container image ?
--
Creating a container image is the process of creating a lightweight, stand-alone executable package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers provide a consistent and reliable way to package and deploy applications, making them portable across different environments.

Here's an overview of the process of creating a container image:

Create a Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for building a container image. The Dockerfile specifies the base image to use, any additional software to install, and any configuration settings to apply.
Build the image: Once the Dockerfile is ready, you can use the docker build command to build the image. This command reads the instructions in the Dockerfile and creates a new image based on them. The docker build command requires the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile as an argument.
Tag the image: After the image is built, you can use the docker tag command to give it a name and version. This makes it easier to manage and share the image.
Push the image: You can use the docker push command to upload the image to a container registry, such as Docker Hub. This makes the image available for others to download and use
