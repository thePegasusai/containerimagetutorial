# Building a container image in C++ is possible but not as straightforward as in other languages such as JavaScript, Rust or Go. Since the Docker daemon is written in Go, the recommended approach is to use the Docker API to interact with it. Therefore, one way to build a container image in C++ is to use a library that provides a C++ wrapper for the Docker API, such as libdocker or docker-cpp

Another way to build a container image in C++ is to use C++ programming language bindings for the Docker SDK, such as docker-sdk-cpp which provides a C++11 interface for the Docker API and can be used to build, inspect, and manage containers, images, networks, and volumes.

Here's an example of how to use the docker-sdk-cpp library to build a container image:

#include <iostream>
#include "docker.hpp"

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    using namespace Docker;
    using Docker::Image;
    using Docker::ImageBuildOptions;

    // Create the client
    auto client = Docker::Client();

    ImageBuildOptions options;
    options.context = "path/to/context";
    options.tag = {"image-name:latest"};
    options.dockerfile = "path/to/Dockerfile";

    // Build the image
    Image image = client.build_image(options);
    cout << "Image ID: " << image.id() << endl;
    return 0;
}


# This code first imports the docker-sdk-cpp library and creates a new client. Then it sets the build options, including the context folder, the image name and the path to the Dockerfile. The build_image function is then called with the options as an argument and returns the built image. The ID of the built image is then printed.

It's worth noting that the docker-sdk-cpp library requires that the Docker daemon is running and that the user running the C++ code has permission to access the Docker daemon.

Keep in mind that building container images in C++ is a less common use case and the libraries available may not be as well-maintained or have a large community as other languages that are more widely used for this purpose.
