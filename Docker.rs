# To build a container image in Rust, you can use the docker-rs library. This library provides a Rust API for interacting with the Docker daemon and can be used to programmatically create, manage, and build container images. Here's an example of how to use docker-rs to build a container image:

use docker::Docker;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let docker = Docker::connect("unix:///var/run/docker.sock").unwrap();
    let build = docker
        .build_image("path/to/Dockerfile", "image-name")
        .unwrap();

    for chunk in build {
        println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&chunk.content));
    }
}

# This code first connects to the Docker daemon using the Docker::connect method. Then it uses the build_image method to build the container image, passing in the path to the Dockerfile and the name of the image as arguments. The function returns an iterator which can be used to get the output of the build process in chunks. The chunks are then printed to the console.

It's worth noting that the docker-rs library requires that the Docker daemon is running, and that the user running the Rust code has permission to access the Docker daemon.

You can also use other libraries such as docker-command-rs or docker-compose-rs to build container images as well
